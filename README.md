In 2017 I hacked my daughter's "Operation" game , connecting it to the paddle input of my Atari 8-bit computer, and wrote a little EKG display program to go with it. The EKG display goes at a steady rate. The first time you "accidentally" touch the metal edge of an Operation hole, the EKG stats going faster. After a second touch, the EKG goes really fast. A third touch, and you lose the patient.

Here's a video of the program in ... operation: https://youtu.be/9_dhrT82Mz0
